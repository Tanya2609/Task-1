  <h1>Mental Health</h1> 
  <h2>What is mental health?</h2>
  <p>A mental illness is a physical illness of the brain that causes disturbances in thinking, behavior, energy or emotion that make it difficult to cope with the ordinary demands of life.
      The cause of this disease can include genetics, brain chemistry, brain structure, experiencing trauma and/or having another medical condition, like heart disease.<br>
      The two most common mental health conditions are:<br>

Anxiety Disorders – More than 18% of adults each year struggle with some type of anxiety disorder, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (panic attacks), generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobias.<br>

Mood Disorders – Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar depression, affect nearly 10% of adults each year and are characterized by difficulties in regulating one’s mood.
